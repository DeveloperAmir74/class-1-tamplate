    <p>We believe robots should be the ones rewriting text. Rewriting text is useful for search engine optimization (SEO), 
        
        making copies of books or papers, for duplicating content in new ways, and for saving hours of human work hours. 
        Automatic rewrite machines on the market currently cost a fortune, and we don't believe they should. Therefore,
         we offer our proprietary rewrite machine in over 100 different languages to make sure everyone has access to text rewriting capabilities</p>
